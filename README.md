Trio - A Trello-Inspired Kanban Board App

Introductionsssss

Trio is a pixel-perfect, end-to-end clone of Trello, a popular project and task management platform. Inspired by the functionality of Trello, Trio aims to provide a familiar and feature-rich experience for managing projects and tasks using a kanban board. This application offers a range of unique features in addition to Trello's core functionality, enhancing your project management experience.

Main Features
Create and Manage Boards: Use drag-and-drop functionality to effortlessly create, remove, and update lists and tasks on your boards.
Task Customization: Customize tasks to the deepest level with options such as labels, due dates, members, cover images, checklists, activity logs, copying, moving, and archiving.
Side Menu: Easily change the board's background using the Unsplash Photo API, filter tasks by members or labels, and access the general activity log.
Accessibility Features: We've implemented a Blind Color Mode to aid users with color blindness and a voice assistant that accepts vocal commands for effortless task management.

Trio is built using the MERN stack:2
